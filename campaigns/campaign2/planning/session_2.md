## **Session Flow**



### **1️⃣ Finishing Up at the Dock - Gavin’s Departure & Tobin’s Role**



[Description current docks](needs link)



#### **Tobin’s Clue to Riven:**



- Unless **someone explicitly mentions Tobin**, Jamie will be **mostly unaware of his involvement**, though he may have heard vague rumors about a young recruit getting in over his head.

- Gavin presses Tobin - he's pissed. Not only did these thugs beat up his crew - they took the list. He NEEDS to get that list back - there is a sense of urgency, but also something he doesn't want the Town Guards to know about.  

- Tobin is **scared and skittish** but **not entirely dumb.** He fidgets, eyes darting between Gavin and the guards, trying to gauge his best move. He mutters half-truths, deflecting with vague answers like, *"I'm.. i'm just tryna make a buck, I dunno nothin' else,"* while subtly testing how much they already know.

- If pressed, he mentions he calls him **"The Black Ledger."**

  - A reference to **Riven Duskbane’s infamous coded book** of debts, blackmail, and secrets.

  - A high **Insight/Streetwise roll** might recognize the name.



#### **Sgt. Gerrard or Curtis Conrad Shows Up:**

- **Curtis Conrad arrives first**, seeing **Tobin in distress**.

- Gavin: He and his "party of thugs" downed 2 of my men!

- Tobin **gets arrested** and will be taken to jail **unless the party intervenes.**

- **Gavin Waterford must leave with Curtis** to give his testimony. He will not be seen again this session.

- Before leaving, Gavin **desperately needs to get a message to Milly.**

  - He whispers to Ash: *"Tell Milly there was a holdup on the dock, and The Countess won't be getting what she needs."*

#### **Setup & How They Get Here:**

- **Gavin realizes Ash knows Milly** and suggests Ash & Vaerien go to **The Third Tusk**.

- If **Vaerien offers to help**, Gavin **gruffly allows it**, but reminds them, *"Stay outta the way, no one else needs to get hurt."*

- Gavin is **furious about the stolen list**, but he keeps it bottled up.



#### **Milly’s Reaction & Push to see Jamie:**

- **Milly is surprised** to see Ash and, after a brief moment of concern, crosses her arms and exhales sharply, shaking her head. She glances her over before muttering, *"Well now, Ash — I didn't expect you turnin' up for another few days. You alright?*" Her voice carries a mix of relief and exasperation, the kind reserved for someone she can't help but look out for. 

- When she hears about **the stolen list and the thieves**, she immediately thinks of Jamie.

- **Why does she know Jamie is at the Tannery?**

  - Jamie recently came into The Third Tusk **with a busted lip and a bruised jaw**.

  - She **fed him for free that night**, knowing his **pride hurt more than his chin**.

  - As he sat there brooding, she muttered, *"Ye reek of tannin' chemicals, lad. Once ye've had that smell in yer nose, ye don't forget it."*  

  - He gave her a **side-smile, knowing he was caught.**

  - She **didn’t think much of it at the time, but now it clicks.**



#### **Hook to the Tannery:**

- *"If anyone knows anyfin' ‘bout this sort of shifty behavia’—it’ll be ‘im."*

- She tells them to head to the **Old Tanning Factory.**

### **4️⃣ The Guild Door - Gilded Shadows Hideout**



#### **Location:** Inside the Old Tanning Factory, concealing the entrance to the Gilded Shadows Hideout.  

#### **Type:** Magical & Mechanical Lock Puzzle  

#### **Security Level:** High  

#### **Access Method:** Solving the riddle using five rotating dials.

> All seek to master me, but none ever will.  

> What am I?"*  

> **Answer:** "CLOCK" or "CLOCK"

### **5️⃣ The Warehouse Fight - Action Sequence**



#### **Possible Twists:**

- If they **fail to solve the riddle**, they are **vastly outnumbered**, and Jamie **has to intervene.**

- If they **crack the door open first**, they **get inside before the fight escalates.** They can sneak up on a few guards - still outnumbered - they just have more options. Jamie will STILL notice them and intervene.



#### **Setting the Scene:**

- The players **struggle with the riddle door** (likely failing).

- A **few thieves inside realize they’re being watched.**

- One thief, **positioned in the rafters, fires a crossbow.**

- **Combat begins.**

- **Thieves rush out, weapons drawn.**

- **One thief provides ranged support from above (unless inside).**

- The fight is **fast and chaotic.**

### **6️⃣ Jamie’s Intervention - The Moment of Recognition**



#### **Jamie’s Entrance:**

- As the battle **looks unwinnable**, Jamie **intervenes.**

- He sees Ash and **recognizes him (but not by name).**

- **Jamie’s opening line:**

  - *"By the Gods - well, if this ain't a fish outta water, I don’t know what is. Lads - hold off on the right pasting. What's a courier gnome like you doin' on this side of town?"*



#### **Why Jamie Helps:**

- Jamie **isn’t just bailing them out**—he’s protecting **his own interests.**

- He **doesn’t want the Gilded Shadows involved in a brawl over nothing.**

- He def. knows Milly by name - and cares about helping - he escorts them to somewhere more private - depending on the convo
