### The Shipyard in the Rain – A Moment of Stillness After the Storm

The rain falls in sheets, hissing as it meets cold stone, washing away the blood that seeps into the cracks between uneven cobblestones. The scent of brine and damp wood hangs thick in the air, mixing with something darker—iron and sweat, the remnants of a fight not long past.

Beyond the dull roar of the rain, the ship remains eerily still—a stark contrast to the streets beyond, where life moves on, indifferent to the bloodshed. The clamor of knives clashing and voices raised in battle barely registers to the city, swallowed by the insistent downpour and the ceaseless bustle of the docks.  The slash of knives and the few shouts of battle seemingly unnoticed by most.  The wooden gangways creak under shifting weight, and there are growing gasps as word begins to spread outward from this epicenter and eyes turn more and more towards \The Four Sea Sons

A heavy mist rises from the harbor, curling like ghostly fingers around the towering masts of docked ships. Ropes sway lazily, slick with rain, while the tide laps hungrily at the wooden pilings. A thick, rhythmic thud echoes from deeper in the yard—someone hammering a crate shut, the sound oddly final.



Then—boots on wet wood. Slow. Deliberate. **The kind of pace that doesn’t need to rush—because they already know they have the upper hand, Gavin's mood shifts from ready stance to immediate focus on the target of his rage.  you...  Gavin turns cold, almost growling towards the unconscious thief.  Binding him in a flash - turning him over Tobin lies crumpled against the damp wood of the dock, his face pale beneath streaks of blood, his clothes soaked not just from the rain but from the night’s violence. His lip is split, one eye swollen shut, and his breathing shallow—ragged. The youth, barely more than a boy, looks far smaller in unconsciousness, the weight of whatever choice led him here pressing upon his slight frame.Gavin slides his hand down into his pouch and pulls out a small glass vial, its surface cool and slick from the moisture in the air. The white powder inside shifts invasively as he uncorks it, releasing a sharp, biting scent into the rain-soaked night.  Uncorking, he waves it beneath the young man's nose.  Springing to life, the young man's breath catches as the sharp scent of the salts forces him back to the surface of waking. He jerks slightly, instinct driving him to recoil, but the bindings hold him firm. His breath is ragged, his body shivering from cold and fear. His swollen eye struggles to focus on Gavin looming above him. A shudder runs through him, and his swollen eye flutters open—blinking rapidly against the rain and the light above him. His expression twists, confusion giving way to recognition and then to fear.

Gavin crouches over him, his shadow long in the dim light. His voice is low, cutting through the rain like a blade.

Gavin (cold, demanding):
'The letter. Who were you working for?'

(The young man swallows hard, hesitating, but Gavin grips his collar, dragging him slightly closer.)

Gavin (firm, pressing):
'Your name. I want it. Now.' 

Gavin (low and steady - a warning):

'Don’t try to run, You're going to tell me exactly what I want to know.'
