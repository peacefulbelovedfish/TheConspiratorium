SESSION 2 Kickoff 

### The Shipyard in the Rain – A Moment of Stillness After the Storm

The rain falls heavier, pattering all about as it meets the stone. The floorboards of the [Sunfire Crest (see Four Sea Sons)](../../../data/towns/belford/businesses/TheFourSeaSons.md) begin washing away the fresh blood, just fallen.   It seeps into the cracks and begins washing out of the scuppers (the drains along the base of the railings). The scent of brine and damp wood lingers, mixing with a darker— blood-iron smell and sweat, the remnants of a fight not long past.

Beyond the dull roar of the rain, the ship remains eerily still—a stark contrast to the streets beyond, where life moves on, indifferent to the bloodshed. The clamor of knives clashing and voices raised in battle barely registers to the city, swallowed by the insistent downpour and the ceaseless bustle of the docks, the battle seemingly unnoticed by most.  The wooden gangways creak under shifting weight, and there are growing gasps as word begins to spread outward from this epicenter like a ripple on a lake.   More and more, you see eyes turning towards The well kept Sunfire Crest.  

The rain hangs in the harbor, curling around the towering masts of docked ships. Ropes sway lazily and slick, while the tide laps hungrily at the wooden pilings. A thick, rhythmic thud echoes from deeper in the yard—someone hammering a crate shut.

Then—boots on wet wood. Slow. Deliberate. **The kind of pace that doesn’t need to rush—because they already know they have the upper hand, Gavin's mood shifts from ready stance to immediate focus on the target of his rage.  

Gavin turns cold, almost growling towards the unconscious thief.  Binding him in a flash - turning him over [The thief laying next to Vaerien (Tobin)](../../../data/towns/belford/npcs/TobinFarrow.md) lies crumpled against the damp wood of the dock, his face pale beneath streaks of blood, his clothes soaked not just from the rain but from the night’s violence. His lip is split, one eye swollen shut, and his breathing shallow—ragged. He seems young, barely more than a boy, looks far smaller in unconsciousness, the weight of whatever choice led him here pressing upon his frame. 

Gavin slides his hand down into his pouch and pulls out a small glass vial, its surface cool and slick from the moisture in the air. The white powder inside shifts invasively. (POP) Uncorking, he waves it beneath the young man's nose.  The young man's breath catches as the sharp scent of the salts forces him back to the surface of waking, (GASP) he springs to life. He jerks slightly, instinct driving him to recoil, but the bindings hold him firm. His breath is ragged, his body shivering from cold and fear. His swollen eye struggles to focus on Gavin looming above him, and his good eye flutters about like a goat trapped under the weight of his predator. His expression twists, confusion giving way to recognition and then to fear.

Gavin crouches over him, his voice is low, cutting through the rain like a blade.

Gavin (G)(cold, demanding): "The Letter - where did he take it?" 
Tobin (T) - "i don't...what letter"
G - The letter. Where is it!! Who took that letter?'

T - (The young man swallows hard, hesitating, but Gavin grips his collar, dragging him slightly closer.)

G (firm, pressing):
'Your name. I want it. Now.' 
T: "...it...I..."
Gavin (low and steady - a warning):

What's your name boy?
T - t..t..Tobin.
'Tobin...You're going to tell me what I need to know.'   
G - Tell me who just ran down the gangway - 
(if players help - Tobin could be persuaded)
T - I only met him a few times - he paid me to come with him - he said it wasn't gonna be nothin' bad - I don't 

(T - knows him from the Crafty Crow.  He doesn't go IN - but [Forty](../../../data/towns/belford/npcs/Forty.md) does.  Forty is def. a street wise young adult.  He has fallen in with the Umbral Pact - and will make his in the end.  He is an "up and comer", and not really one to be trifled with.  

Before long - Ash will arrive and Gavin will direct her (OR curtis will - and will take Tobin away.  [Shae](../../../data/towns/belford/npcs/ShaeLock.md) can lead Vaerian to the Third Tusk).

If it's Shae - Gavin will direct her with the following code word:

G - Shae - you gotta tell Mildred that the Countess' delivery has been disrupted.

## **Additional Details:**  
PERCEPTION
- DC 8 - Tobin has a bandage wrapped around his wrist - it's odd given the placement.  It hides a fresh scar.  A circle with five spikes sticking out of it, (THe Umbral Pact symbol - an eye with five nails driven into it)   
    regionally known - 
- DC 12 - A single broken dagger near Tobin’s collapsed form—a standard, unremarkable weapon, except the hilt is wrapped in dark red cloth, it's not a typical hide, and is reminiscent of Thieves Cant. 
- DC 15 - Along the mooring near the Gangway - you see a symbol carved.  It looks fresh - like it was used as a sign.  Upon pointing it out - Curtis Conrad may recognize it as a symbol of interest to the Town Guard
