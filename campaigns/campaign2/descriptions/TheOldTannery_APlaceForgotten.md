### The Tannery – A Forgotten Relic of Industry

The tannery stands ahead, its skeletal frame of warped wood and rusted iron silhouetted against the fragile morning light. A faint staleness lingers in the air—acrid chemicals and rotting leather, stubborn remnants of its past. Water trickles from broken eaves, streaking blackened walls where old dye stains still seem to bleed. The once-sturdy sign above the entrance hangs at an angle, its paint long stripped by wind and time, leaving only deep gouges in the wood where letters once declared its name.

Damp mud pools in uneven dips pock-marking the ground all around, and swallowing cracked cobblestones under slow-moving water. A neglected wooden walkway, warped and splintered, stretches toward the entrance, its planks creaking under the weight of even the lightest step. The few windows that remain intact are clouded with grime, their interiors dark and uninviting. What little light manages to pierce the gloom reveals nothing but shadowed shapes, indistinct and unmoving—yet something about them makes it impossible to shake the feeling that the tannery is not as empty as it seems.

The tannery sits in eerie stillness. No market stalls spill onto the streets, no merchants call out their wares. The only sound is the squelch of your boots through thick mud, the occasional drip of water slipping from broken gutters, and the distant calls of merchants reclaiming their street corners. But the tannery remains silent—watchful, as if the building itself has eyes, waiting to see who dares to linger. It's a stark contrast to the bustling docks just a few streets away, where the hum of trade and the shouts of laborers make it hard to believe you're even in the same city.


### The Hidden Door – A Test of the Shadows

The hallway is narrow, damp, and filled with debris. Torchlight flickers weakly, casting long shadows.. Crumbled stone and broken wooden beams litter the ground, forcing careful steps over refuse left undisturbed for years. The air is thick and damp, heavy with the scent of mildew, old leather, and something faintly metallic—rust or blood, it's hard to tell. The flickering remnants of torchlight barely reach these depths, leaving much of the space swallowed in murky shadow.

the Door

-----------

At the corridor’s end stands a solid iron door, its violet glow cutting through the dimness. Its icy surface hums faintly, its surface is icy cold, its presence undeniable.  It's smooth, lined with rivets, but otherwise featureless save for the faint, unnatural glow that clings to its edges. Though the room itself is dim, the door almost hums with presence, casting a faint violet sheen onto the nearby walls. Its surface is impossibly cold to the touch.

Above, an inscription begins to glow, forming a riddle.  An intricate panel embedded in the iron, hosting five rotating alphabetic dials. Above it, a barely visible inscription begins to glow, its lettering igniting in a slow, pulsing rhythm. The purple light intensifies as the words form into something legible—a riddle waiting to be answered.

Markings on the walls—a watching **eye**, three **lines** urging caution, an **unfinished spiral**, a small **X**, and a broken **arrow** stopping short. To the untrained eye, they are nothing more than scratches or chipped stone. But for those who know to look:

- A crudely carved **eye** near the entrance, its gaze set towards the door—**a warning.**
- Three horizontal lines etched into the far wall—**a reminder to tread lightly.**
- A half-formed **spiral**, unfinished—**a sign of unfinished business or abandonment.**
- A faint **X** near the base of the door—**this place is marked, but why?**
- A stylized arrow, broken halfway—**leading somewhere, but stopping short.**
