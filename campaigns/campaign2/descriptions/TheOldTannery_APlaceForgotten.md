## **Description:**  
### The Tannery – A Forgotten Relic of Industry

On the way there, Damp mud pools lie pock-marking the ground all around, and cracked cobblestones barely surface in slow-moving water. A neglected wooden walkway, warped and splintered, stretches toward the entrance, its planks creaking under the weight of even the lightest step. The few windows along the street that remain intact are clouded with grime, their interiors dark and uninviting. What little light manages to pierce the gloom reveals nothing but shadowed shapes.  As you approach the Tannery, something about them makes it impossible to shake the feeling that the tannery is not as empty as it seems.

The tannery stands ahead.   No market stalls spill onto the streets, no merchants call out their wares. The only sound is the squelch of your boots through thick mud, the occasional drip of water slipping from broken gutters.  But the tannery itself remains watchful, almost as if the building itself has eyes, waiting to see who dares to linger. It's a stark contrast to the bustling docks back at the shipyard.  The silence here makes it hard to believe you're even in the same city.

Its skeletal frame of warped wood and rusted iron silhouetted against the morning light. There is a staleness lingering in the air, the smell of acrid chemicals and rotting leather. Water trickles from broken eaves, streaking blackened walls where old dye stains still seem to have bleed. There is a sturdy sign barely hanging above the entrance hangs at an angle, leaving only deep gouges in the wood where letters once were (Red's Tannery).

### The Hidden Door – A Test of the Shadows

The hallway is narrow, damp, and filled with debris. A glowing stone flickers weakly, casting feint shadows.. Crumbled stone and broken wooden beams litter the ground, forcing careful steps over refuse left undisturbed for years. The air is thick and damp, heavy with the scent of mildew, old leather, and something faintly metallic—rust or blood, it's hard to tell. The flickering remnants of torchlight barely reach these depths, leaving much of the space swallowed in murky shadow.

the Door

-----------

At the corridor’s end stands a solid iron door, its violet glow cutting through the dimness. Its icy surface hums faintly, its surface is icy cold, its presence undeniable.  It's smooth, lined with rivets, but otherwise featureless save for the faint, unnatural glow that clings to its edges. Though the room itself is dim, the door almost hums with presence, casting a faint violet sheen onto the nearby walls. Its surface is impossibly cold to the touch.

 An intricate panel embedded in the iron, with five small cylindrical dials, a barely visible inscription begins to glow, its lettering igniting in a slow, pulsing rhythm. The purple light intensifies as the words form into something legible—a riddle waiting to be answered, forming a riddle. 


### ADDITIONAL DETAILS
Markings on the walls—a watching **eye**, three **lines** urging caution, an **unfinished spiral**, a small **X**, and a broken **arrow** stopping short. To the untrained eye, they are nothing more than scratches or chipped stone. But for those who know to look:

- A crudely carved **eye** near the entrance, its gaze set towards the door—**a warning.**
- Three horizontal lines etched into the far wall—**a reminder to tread lightly.**
- A half-formed **spiral**, unfinished—**a sign of unfinished business or abandonment.**
- A faint **X** near the base of the door—**this place is marked, but why?**
- A stylized arrow, broken halfway—**leading somewhere, but stopping short.**
