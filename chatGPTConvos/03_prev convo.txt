I want to create a player called Elder - he is a dragon born kid with two toy swords in the city of Belford.  He will be a prop tool to help me get Farah back to The Third Tusk.

Elder sounds like a fun and engaging way to nudge Farah back to The Third Tusk! Do you want him to have a specific personality—mischievous, naive, or maybe overly serious about his "warrior training"? Also, should he have any connections to The Third Tusk, or is he just a random street kid who crosses paths with Farah?

ok - more anima style - and make the sword wooden.  He should be wearing common clothes, but with a cape and a hood

That’s a solid family setup! Elder’s parents sound like they’d be well-respected craftspeople in Belford. Do they run a shop together, or do they work independently? Also, do you want their business to have a name, or is it more of a quiet family operation?






You said:
can you make a family photo of them?

They work together, but in different sides of the shop, and they sometimes bicker about getting in each other's way.  It's def a family operation - but they are respected in Belford

A family portrait of a Dragonborn family in an anime-style drawing. The family consists of three members:
- A young Dragonborn child with shimmery blue, purple, and yellow scales, pointy ears, a dragon-like snout, and playful green eyes. He holds two wooden toy swords and has a mischievous grin.
- His mother, Sarah, a Dragonborn woman in her late 20s/early 30s with strong, well-built arms. She wears a smith's apron over practical armor-making clothes, with a few tools hanging from her belt. She has a slightly exasperated but loving expression.
- His father, Guardian, a Dragonborn man in his late 20s/early 30s, with a smith’s apron over his sword-making attire. He holds a newly crafted sword in one hand and looks amused but slightly annoyed.
The background shows their family-operated smithy in Belford, with armor and swords displayed on different sides of the shop. The scene captures a warm, slightly chaotic family dynamic, with hints of friendly bickering.
Here’s the family portrait of Elder, Sarah, and Guardian in their smithy! You can see the dynamic between them—hardworking, a little chaotic, but full of warmth. Let me know if you’d like any adjustments!
