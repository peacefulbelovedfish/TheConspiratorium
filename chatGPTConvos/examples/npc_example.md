## Jamie "The Coyote" Watt

**Race:** Human  
**Class:** Rogue (Scout)  
**Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral  
**Affiliation:** [Thieves' Guild](../towns/belford/guilds/GildedShadows.md)  

### **Visual Description:**  
A young human rogue with sharp wit and sharper instincts. Jamie has short black hair, smooth golden skin, and distinct but not overly aggressive pointed features. His deep blue eyes always seem to be sizing up a situation, looking for an advantage. He wears a long dark red coat over studded leather armor and carries a black satchel slung over his shoulder. A few gold bracelets dangle from his left wrist, which he constantly fiddles with—a nervous habit or just a display of wealth, who can say?

### **Personality:**  
Jamie is witty, sly, and always on the lookout for an opportunity. He makes his living connecting people to the **Thieves' Guild**, finding the right jobs for the right hands. He considers his work "honest enough"—after all, he’s not the one doing the stealing. Friendly but never too familiar, he keeps people at arm’s length, preferring charm and distance over real connections. He loves attention but knows he should stay under the radar—this internal conflict sometimes gets him into trouble.
