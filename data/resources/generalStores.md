3️⃣ Six Copper Sundries – A cheap, run-down general store, but sometimes has rare forgotten goods in stock.
4️⃣ Oak & Coin – Run by a former adventurer, specializes in survival gear and field-tested equipment.
5️⃣ The Stubborn Mule – Sells mostly travel supplies, feed, and animal gear—but also strange relics from far-off lands.
6️⃣ Bailey’s Bizarre Bazaar – Nothing in the shop is labeled; every item has a story, if you can get the owner to tell it.
