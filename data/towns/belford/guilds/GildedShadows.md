## Player Description:

## **Player Description:**  
From the outside, the [Old Tanning Factory](../towns/belford/OldTanningFactory.md) appears abandoned, its stench of decayed leather lingering in the air. The crumbling vats and rusted tools speak of a business long dead. But for those who know where to look, this ruin conceals the most lucrative criminal empire in Belford.

A secret entrance lies behind a **warped storage cabinet**, its surface etched with the tally marks of forgotten workers. A **precise knock sequence**—three quick raps and a downward press—unseals a heavy stone panel, revealing a descending stairway into opulence.

Beneath the factory, the contrast is stark. The **Gilded Shadows’ hideout** is a **lavish underground lair**, filled with **silken banners, fine rugs, and golden candelabras**. Every piece of furniture, from the polished darkwood tables to the velvet-lined chairs, is a display of wealth, all taken from Belford’s elite. 

The air is **thick with the scent of exotic tobacco and fine wines**, a stark contrast to the filth above. This is not just a hideout—it is a testament to **power earned in the shadows**.

## **General Description**

Opulent and well-secured, the hideout serves as a meeting place, headquarters, and sanctuary for the guild's members. The space is filled with luxurious furniture, silken banners, and stolen wealth, exuding an air of prosperity and power.

# The Guild Door - Gilded Shadows Hideout

**Location:** Inside the Old Tanning Factory, concealing the entrance to the Gilded Shadows Hideout.  
**Type:** Magical & Mechanical Lock Puzzle  
**Security Level:** High  
**Access Method:** Solving the riddle using five rotating dials.

---

## **Door Description**

Hidden behind an aged **storage cabinet**, this **iron door** stands in stark contrast to the rotting wood and rusted tools around it. Unlike the surrounding decay, its surface is **smooth, cold, and unnaturally preserved**. No handles, no hinges—just **five interlocking dials**, each etched with the full **alphabet**. Above the dials, an inscription shimmers faintly, waiting for an answer:

> *"I am taken from the past but never stolen.  
> I am given to all, yet none can keep me.  
> I may be spent, but never saved.  
> All seek to master me, but none ever will.  
> What am I?"*

**Answer:** "TIME" or "CLOCK"

---

## **Mechanism & Rules**

### **Using the Dials**
- The players must rotate the **five-letter dials** to spell the correct answer.
- The door allows **three attempts** before triggering a consequence.
- The dials give subtle feedback:
  - **Correct letters click smoothly** into place.
  - **Incorrect letters resist slightly** but still rotate.
  - A **high Investigation (DC 15+)** may help players notice this pattern.

### **Perception Clues**
- **Low Perception (DC 10+):** The **gears** engraved into the door appear **stuck in place**, as if part of a broken mechanism.
- **High Perception (DC 15+):** A faint, rhythmic **ticking sound** can be heard from **within the door**, like an unseen clockwork device.

---

## **Consequences of Failure**

### **First Incorrect Attempt:**
- A deep **rumbling** echoes from within the door.
- The letters **flicker dimly**, acknowledging the failure.

### **Second Incorrect Attempt:**
- The gears on the door **briefly shift**, but snap back into place.
- A soft, **ominous ticking sound begins** within the metal.
- A creeping **sense of dread** fills the air—one more mistake could be costly.

### **Third Incorrect Attempt (Final Chance):**
- The door **violently swings open** with a **metallic groan**, alerting those inside.
- **A crossbow bolt is fired immediately** from a **balcony above** (Attack +6, 1d10+3 piercing).
- **Guild enforcers (3-4) rush in** to engage the intruders.
- Every creature **within 5 feet** of the door must make a **DC 14 Constitution save** or take **4d6 necrotic damage** as dark veins lash out, draining life force.
- The **dials reset to random letters**, locking the players out for **one hour** before another attempt can be made.

---

## **Bypassing the Lock**
- **Thieves' Tools (DC 18):** A rogue can attempt to override the mechanism.
- **Arcana Check (DC 16):** Detects a magical ward tied to time magic.
- **Detect Magic / Identify:** Reveals an enchantment preventing brute force entry.
- **Force Entry:** Not possible—the door is **immune to non-magical damage**.

---

## **Successful Entry**
When the correct word is entered:
- The dials **click into place**, and the gears behind the door **grind into motion**.
- A final **chime rings out**, and the door **silently slides open**, revealing the stairway down into the **Gilded Shadows Hideout**.
