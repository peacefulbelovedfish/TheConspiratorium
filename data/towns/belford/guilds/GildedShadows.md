---

## Player Description:
From the outside, there is no indication that anything of value lies within the decrepit remains of the old tanning factory. The place stinks of damp leather and chemicals long seeped into the floor, its broken vats and rusted tools a testament to its abandonment. But for those who know where to look, the factory is merely a shell—a false front disguising something far more deliberate.

Past the ruined workstations and the yawning vats of stagnant water, a hidden entrance waits behind a warped storage cabinet, its surface still etched with the tally marks of workers long gone. A precise touch—three quick raps and a downward press—unseals the heavy stone panel behind it, revealing a descending stairway, the scent of damp industry fading as it gives way to something richer, more intoxicating.

Beneath the factory, the contrast is stark. The Gilded Shadows' hideout is a cavernous sanctuary of illicit success. Silken banners drape the walls, their embroidered patterns catching the flickering glow of golden candelabras. Thick rugs soften the stone beneath footfalls, and every surface, from the polished darkwood tables to the intricately carved chairs, is a casual display of wealth.

At the heart of the space, a long banquet table is always laden with food, drink, and loose coin, as if to remind those who enter just how profitable life can be for those willing to take it. Hidden corridors snake away from the main hall—some leading to private quarters, others to passageways that spill into the city's underbelly, allowing the guild to come and go unseen.

The air is thick with the scent of expensive tobacco and exotic spices, a stark contrast to the rotting leather above. Here, in the depths of Belford, power thrives in the shadows, hidden in plain sight beneath the bones of a forgotten trade.

## **General Description**

Hidden beneath the decaying remains of the Old Tanning Factory, the Gilded Shadows Hideout is a stark contrast to its grimy exterior. Opulent and well-secured, the hideout serves as a meeting place, headquarters, and sanctuary for the guild's members. The space is filled with luxurious furniture, silken banners, and stolen wealth, exuding an air of prosperity and power.

**Location:** Inside the Old Tanning Factory, concealing the entrance to the Gilded Shadows Hideout.  
**Type:** Magical & Mechanical Lock Puzzle  
**Security Level:** High  
**Access Method:** Solving the riddle using five rotating dials.

---

## **Door Description**

Hidden behind an aged **storage cabinet**, this **iron door** stands in stark contrast to the rotting wood and rusted tools around it. Unlike the surrounding decay, its surface is **smooth, cold, and unnaturally preserved**. No handles, no hinges—just **five interlocking dials**, each etched with the full **alphabet**. Above the dials, an inscription shimmers faintly, waiting for an answer:

> *"I am taken from the past but never stolen.  
> I am given to all, yet none can keep me.  
> I may be spent, but never saved.  
> All seek to master me, but none ever will.  
> What am I?"*

**Answer:** "TIME" or "CLOCK"

---

## **Mechanism & Rules**

### **Using the Dials**
- The players must rotate the **five-letter dials** to spell the correct answer.
- The door allows **three attempts** before triggering a consequence.
- The dials give subtle feedback:
  - **Correct letters click smoothly** into place.
  - **Incorrect letters resist slightly** but still rotate.
  - A **high Investigation (DC 15+)** may help players notice this pattern.

### **Perception Clues**
- **Low Perception (DC 10+):** The **gears** engraved into the door appear **stuck in place**, as if part of a broken mechanism.
- **High Perception (DC 15+):** A faint, rhythmic **ticking sound** can be heard from **within the door**, like an unseen clockwork device.

---

## **Consequences of Failure**

### **First Incorrect Attempt:**
- A deep **rumbling** echoes from within the door.
- The letters **flicker dimly**, acknowledging the failure.

### **Second Incorrect Attempt:**
- The gears on the door **briefly shift**, but snap back into place.
- A soft, **ominous ticking sound begins** within the metal.
- A creeping **sense of dread** fills the air—one more mistake could be costly.

### **Third Incorrect Attempt (Final Chance):**
- The door **violently swings open** with a **metallic groan**, alerting those inside.
- **A crossbow bolt is fired immediately** from a **balcony above** (Attack +6, 1d10+3 piercing).
- **Guild enforcers (3-4) rush in** to engage the intruders.
- Every creature **within 5 feet** of the door must make a **DC 14 Constitution save** or take **4d6 necrotic damage** as dark veins lash out, draining life force.
- The **dials reset to random letters**, locking the players out for **one hour** before another attempt can be made.

---

## **Bypassing the Lock**
- **Thieves' Tools (DC 18):** A rogue can attempt to override the mechanism.
- **Arcana Check (DC 16):** Detects a magical ward tied to time magic.
- **Detect Magic / Identify:** Reveals an enchantment preventing brute force entry.
- **Force Entry:** Not possible—the door is **immune to non-magical damage**.

---

## **Successful Entry**
When the correct word is entered:
- The dials **click into place**, and the gears behind the door **grind into motion**.
- A final **chime rings out**, and the door **silently slides open**, revealing the stairway down into the **Gilded Shadows Hideout**.
