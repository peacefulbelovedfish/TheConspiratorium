# Belford Town Guard

## **Overview:**

The **Belford Town Guard** is responsible for **maintaining order, protecting citizens, and enforcing local laws** within the city of Belford. While officially a force of law and protection, the guard operates under a mix of **strict discipline, political influence, and occasional corruption**. Officers range from **honorable defenders of the city** to **power-hungry enforcers using their position for personal gain**.

- **Captain of the Guard:** Oversees the entire force, ensuring stability in Belford’s districts.
- **Lieutenants:** Manage different boroughs of the city, reporting to the Captain.
- **Sergeants:** Command squads, assign patrols, and act as field leaders.
  - **[Sergeant Tibalt Gerrard](../npcs/TibaltGerrard.md)** (Goliath) is a **seasoned officer** with a reputation for practical efficiency.
- **Standard Guardsmen:** Regular officers responsible for patrols, investigations, and peacekeeping.
  - **[Curtis Conrad](../npcs/CurtisConrad.md)** (Half-Elf) works as a **desk administrator**, ensuring paperwork and logistics are handled efficiently.

## **Internal Conflicts & Politics:**

- The **Lower Boroughs guard unit** has a reputation for **being involved** and **invested**, while there are some bad eggs, Sgt. Gerrard works hard to weed them out.  He understands the thieves guild is connected, and he'll "tow the line if need be", but generally he wants to build a reliable and trustworthy force. &#x20;
- Some higher-ranking guards **prioritize protecting nobles and influential merchants** over common citizens\
  \* The closer they are to the stree, like **[Sergeant Gerrard](../npcs/TibaltGerrard.md)**, **resent bureaucracy** and take matters into their own hands.
- **Corrupt factions** exist within the guard, making **true justice difficult to achieve**.

## **Notable Locations:**

- **Belford Guard Headquarters:** The main base, where **the Captain of the Guard and high-ranking officers** operate.  It's in the Commercial District - downtown - but not quite near the sea-side market.  
- **Lower Boroughs Guard Station:** Located near **The Third Tusk**, where **Curtis Conrad**  and Sgt. Gerrard work.
- **The Iron Stockade:** A **temporary holding facility** for criminals before trial.
