### **Brief Summary**  
The wife of **[Lord Cornwall](../npcs/LordCornwall.md)**, but far more than just a noble’s spouse—Lady Cornwall is a **master of political maneuvering**, ensuring that her husband’s rule remains intact while subtly directing power behind the scenes.  She is arrogant, but has the smarts to match. Cunning and manipulative.  

### **Visual Description:**  
A **graceful and impeccably dressed woman**, always adorned in **regal but not ostentatious attire**. Her **piercing gaze and composed demeanor** command respect, even in rooms filled with powerful men. She wears **deep emeralds and silvers**, symbolizing her role as a tactician rather than a warrior. She has a signet around her forehead, and her hair is usually found pulled back.  The exception to this are the festivals, where she will be found in profoundly elegant, and striking attire. 

She has very long, curled, golden hair and blue eyes, with smooth brown skin.  
She stands 5'11" tall and has a thin build.
She has very pointed cheekbones, and sharp features.  She possesses an unexpected beauty, not classically, but something about her is striking.

- **Knows of External Threats?** If the city is already under the control of an outside force, **she may be aware and working to either counter it or align with it**.
