**Race:** Human  
**Class:** Rogue (Untrained)

### Brief Summary
A naive teenage thief who got in over his head working with the [Umbral Pact](../guilds/UmbralPact.md). [Jamie Watt](../npcs/JamieWatt.md) knows him personally and is furious to learn of his involvement in criminal activity, vowing to set him straight.*

### **Family**
**Mother**: Ellen Farrow – A kind but weary woman, always looking out for her son, but unable to shield him from everything.
**Father** (Deceased): Osric Farrow - His mother doesn’t talk much about his father, only that he was a good man, and the sea took him too soon.

### **Visual Description:**  
A **scrawny teenager**, no older than **15 or 16**, with **messy brown hair and nervous eyes**.  
His **clothes are too big for him**, like he stole them off a grown man, and his boots are clearly secondhand.  
Tobin constantly **fidgets with the hem of his coat** when he’s scared (which is often).  

### **Personality:**  
Tobin **isn’t dumb**, but he’s **terrified and in way over his head**.  
He thought working with the **Umbral Pact** would be a good opportunity—**easy money, no real danger**. He was wrong.  
Now he’s **trapped between a dangerous guild and Jamie Watt, who won’t be happy when he finds out what Tobin’s done**.  

He **wants to be brave**, but the truth is, he’s **just a scared kid who made a mistake**.

### **Notable Features:**  
- **Bites his nails** when nervous (his fingers are constantly raw).

### **Wants:**  
- To **get out of this mess** before Jamie finds out.  
- To **make enough coin** to help his mother, who works long hours at the docks.  
- To **prove he’s not just some scared kid** (even though he is).  

### **Fears:**  
- That **Jamie will tell his mom**—that scares him more than the Umbral Pact.  
- That **[Garlo "Ox" Belmaris](../npcs/GarloBelmaris.md)** or the Pact will come after him for trying to run.  
- That he’s **too deep in now** and **there’s no way out**.  

### **Secrets & Hooks:**  
- **[Jamie Watt](../npcs/JamieWatt.md)** knows Tobin and his mother.
- **Jamie will be furious when he finds out Tobin worked with the Umbral Pact** and will threaten to tell his mother.

### **Quotes:**
