### Brief Summary
The powerful and enigmatic leader of the [Gilded Shadows](../guilds/GildedShadows.md), whose criminal empire operates out of the [Old Tanning Factory](../../../../campaigns/campaign2/descriptions/TheOldTannery_APlaceForgotten.md). Though ruthless, he understands the importance of balance and keeps the city’s underworld from descending into chaos.*

### **Visual Description:**  
A towering half-orc with broad shoulders and a presence that fills any room. Garlo has deep-set eyes, calculating and cold, always measuring those around him. His short black hair is peppered with gray, a sign of his long rule over the underworld. He dresses in practical but fine dark clothing, favoring deep reds and gold accents. He wears a heavy signet ring—one that carries the symbol of the **[Gilded Shadows](../guilds/GildedShadows.md)**, marking him as its undisputed ruler. His voice is low and steady, each word weighted with meaning.

### **Personality:**  
Garlo is **ruthless, patient, and strategic**—a predator that never strikes without reason. He believes in **absolute control**, not just over his guild but over **Belford's entire criminal underbelly**. He doesn't tolerate chaos; everything runs according to **his** design. Unlike petty crime bosses, he isn’t reckless—he plays the **long game**, making careful moves, collecting favors, and eliminating threats before they even know they exist. His **calm, controlled demeanor** makes him all the more terrifying—when he raises his voice, people listen.
