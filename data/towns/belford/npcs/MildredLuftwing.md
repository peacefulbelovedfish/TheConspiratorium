### Brief Summary
A Dwarven merchant who owns [The Third Tusk](../businesses/TheThirdTusk.md), a tavern that serves as a neutral ground for various factions. She is well-connected and often acts as an information broker, knowing far more about Belford’s underworld than she lets on.

* Unbeknownst to Ash, she has been sending messages embedded within deliveries.  Envelopes in a basket covered with a blanket, using thieves 


### **Visual Description:**
A stout, broad-shouldered dwarven woman with a strong presence.
Her auburn hair is streaked with gray, always tied back in a tight bun, but her light red beard is neatly braided and well-kept. 
She wears a well-worn, faded, but functional patchwork apron, always stocked with a small pad of paper and a pencil for quick notes, and her rough hands bear the calluses of a lifetime of hard work. 

### **Personality:**
Milly is an energetic, no-nonsense innkeeper with a sharp tongue and an even sharper eye for trouble. 
She runs The Third Tusk with a mix of motherly concern and exasperated pragmatism. 
She tolerates a bit of mischief but has zero patience for anyone messing up her establishment. 
Beneath her tough exterior, she has a deep care for the people of Belford and a strong sense of community loyalty. 
She’s well-connected, both among legitimate business owners and the people in the city, making her an invaluable source of information.

Years ago, a drunk sailor picked a fight in her bar, breaking furniture and harassing patrons. 
Without hesitation, Milly grabbed him by the scruff of his collar and personally tossed him out the front door. 
The event has since become a running joke among regulars, particularly one patron who loves to bring it up whenever things get rowdy. 
Milly secretly appreciates the attention, but she always waves it off with a gruff, 'That was years ago—he had it coming.'  

### **Skills & Talents:**

### **Wants:**

- To keep her bar in good standing and free of major trouble  

### **Fears:**

- Fears the increasing presence of the [Umbral Pact](../guilds/UmbralPact.md) in Belford  
- Avoids close relationships after losing her second husband—prefers to keep emotional distance  

### **Secrets & Hooks:**  
- Milly does not have ties to the [Gilded Shadows](../guilds/GildedShadows.md) but has a long history with [Jamie "The Coyote" Watt](../npcs/JamieWatt.md).  
- She is the one to send the party to the temples when they need guidance  
- She knows Jamie "The Coyote" Watt well and trusts his instincts, despite his profession.  She would NEVER call him The Coyote as she sees it as part of his obnoxious bravado. 

### **Quotes:**  
- "If you’re gonna cause trouble, at least buy a drink first."
- "I don’t run a charity, but I ain’t heartless either."

### **Notable Game Moments:**

- She assists in sending/receiving messages because deep down she knows it's the "right" thing.  This is why she uses Ash as her courier.
