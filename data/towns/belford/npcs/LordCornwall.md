## Lord Cornwall

**Race:** Human  
**Class:** Noble (Governor of Belford)  
**Alignment:** Lawful Neutral  
**Affiliation:** Governing Lord of Belford  

### **Voice Direction**
Khary Payton/King Ezekial vibes - kind soft voice, but firm.   

### **Brief Summary**  
The official **Governing Lord of Belford**, overseeing laws, trade, and political stability. Though he holds authority over the city, there are forces working behind the scenes to manipulate his rule.  But with that in mind, the [Town Guard](../guilds/BelfordTownGuard.md) is still deeply loyal to him.  They trust him, and they have their own reputations to protect in the name of "Order".

### **Visual Description:**  
A **distinguished, older gentleman** with **silver-streaked long braided hair and a neatly trimmed van-dyke beard (mustache and goatee not connected)**. His eyes stand out - starkly contrasting, beautiful cyan eyes.  He dresses in **fine but practical attire**, favoring **dark blues and deep reds** to symbolize Belford’s maritime and trade-heavy economy. He carries himself with an air of **calculated control**, rarely showing emotion beyond measured politeness. But with that, he is swift to act, and willing to shift or roll back if need be. 

He stands 177cm (5'9") tall and has a skinny build.
He has a long thin face with a very short van dyke beard.
He would rather act than talk or think.

### **Personality:**  
- **Calm and calculated**, rarely raising his voice.  
- **Firm, but not unnecessarily cruel**—his rule is pragmatic.  
- **Listens to his wife, [Lady Cornwall](../npcs/LadyCornwall.md)**, knowing her political instincts often surpass his own.  
- **Works closely with [Gundren Rockseeker](../npcs/GundrenRockseeker.md)**, seeing him as a valuable asset to Belford’s economy.  

### **Wants & Fears:**  
- **Wants:** 
  * To keep Belford thriving as a center of commerce and political stability.  
  * To retain his Appointed position as the governing ruler (appointed by the King of Farheim.)
- **Fears:** 
  * His worries that the trust with his wife’s side-gig will be their undoing.  She is sometimes seen in darker circles - and is even involved in the cultists actions.  Lord Cornwall doesn’t know the extent of her involvement.  He is not naive, but prefers to opt for avoidant.  
  *  That outside forces or internal corruption will **weaken his rule**.  
  * **Does not fully realize** the extent to which **Gundren and his own wife maneuver power behind his back.**  

### **Secrets & Hooks:**  
- **Unknowingly a puppet?** Though Lord Cornwall governs **on paper**, his **decisions are heavily influenced** by the **Merchant’s Guild and his wife’s backroom dealings**.  
- **Under external control?** The city is already subtly **under the power of an unknown force**, though he doesn’t realize it yet.  
- **Conflict Brewing?** If he discovers how much control others wield over Belford, **he may either rebel against it or become fully complicit.**  

### **Notable Game Moments:**
