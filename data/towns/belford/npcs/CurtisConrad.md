### Brief Summary
A young Half-Elf administrator who works at the Lower Boroughs Guard Station, handling logistics and paperwork. Though not a fighter, he excels at keeping things organized and de-escalating tense situations with diplomacy.

### **Visual Description:**

A **young Half-Elf, around 20 years old**, with **short brownish-orange hair** and **dark brown skin covered in freckles**. His **pointy ears peek out from beneath a small cap** that is part of his **Town Guard uniform**. Curtis is **skinny and small**, but not weak—he is cap...

- **Town Guard Uniform**: A **dark blue tunic** with a **dark red stripe on one shoulder**.
- Keeps a **satchel for clerical duties**, containing reports, ink, and sealed letters.

### **Wants & Fears:**

- **Wants:** 
  * To remain in his administrative role and avoid getting pulled into field work.
  * He wants to settle down someday and do the family life thing - he's hoping to have kids and eventually parent.  
  * He likes to have evenings of decadence - to feel fancy.  He likes to go out and have a nice glass of wine and visit the theater (at least what little is available in Belford).
  * Losing himself in the guard, he enjoys what he does, but he could see life getting away from him.  He's trying to save up and maybe go buy a farm on the outskirts of town (just beyond the town walls).  
  *  Gets nervous around women, but generally he is naive and he isn't in touch with his own fears enough to be legitimately afraid. 

### **Notable Game Moments:**

- **Campaign 1 Interaction:** When the party first encountered Curtis at the Belford Town Guard station in **The Lower Boroughs**, the conversation went 
  - *Curtis looks up and says* **"Uh...hello - what brings you here today?"**
  - *Sergeant Gerrard hands him a folded parchment:* **"Conrad, make sure this letter gets to the regent—and don’t get lost this time."**
  - *Curtis fumbles slightly, then quickly replies:* **"Uh...yessir!"**

### **Background & Family:**

- Curtis’s **family is from Myendria**, but his mother fell in love with a **human from Farheim**.
- They settled in **Belford**, where Curtis still sees them often.
- His parents come from \*\*small-town...
  **his administrative role suits him well**.

### **Combat & Diplomacy:**

- **His mace is plain, functional, and certainly unused**—he carries it as part of regulation but has **never needed to use it in a fight**.
- **He excels in diplomacy and de-escalation techniques**, often diffusing tensions before conflicts escalate.
- While he has **intentionally brandished his mace a few times**, he relies on **calm reasoning and structured negotiation** to keep situations under control.
