## Player Description  
Belford is a bustling **port city** off the northern coast of Farheim. The streets are alive with noise—the calls of merchants peddling their wares, the rhythmic clip-clop of horses, and the grinding of wagon wheels on the cobbled roads.  

The air is thick with **a mix of scents**: the dust of a well-traveled city, the pungent tang of animal dung and grime, and the more pleasant aromas of fresh bread from a nearby bakery, sizzling bacon from an open kitchen, and a peculiar scent wafting from the local tannery.
