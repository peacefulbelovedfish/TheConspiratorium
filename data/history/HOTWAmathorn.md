# **The History of Amathorn & The Eternal Conflict**

# The Great Schism:

###### In the rich tapestry of Amathorn's history, a profound schism among the elven populace has endured for millennia, rooted not merely in the pursuit of power but in a deep ideological divide concerning morality and the essence of their alliances.



During the Age of Silence, as the world grappled with the aftermath of Karsus’s Folly and the destabilization of magic, the elves of Amathorn faced a pivotal decision. One faction, later known as the Umbralin, believed that to safeguard their people and reclaim lost glory, they should embrace the power offered by darker entities. They argued that forming alliances with demons and the emerging Tiefling societies of West Amathorn was a pragmatic approach to survival and dominance.



Opposing them were the Lumineth, who held steadfast to traditional elven values, emphasizing purity, natural harmony, and the guidance of benevolent deities. They viewed the Umbralin's approach as a dangerous perversion, risking the very soul of elvenkind.  This marked the beginning of **The Vaelithian Strife**, known among the Elves as Ithar'Anthalas—the Sundering of Kin..



## **The Age of Silence (\~3,000 - 4,500 years ago)**

- The **Umbralin & Lumineth factions emerge**, debating the use of dark powers and alliances.
- The first **skirmishes between the factions** begin, initially small but growing in intensity.
- **Tieflings of West Amathorn** form **alliances with the Umbralin**, believing it will lead to a stronger, unified front.
- The Lumineth warn that these alliances **threaten the purity and survival of elvenkind**, escalating tensions.

## The Vaelithian Strife - known to the Elves as the Sundering of Kin (Ithar'Anthalas, aka - a deep cultural wound)

Even as this constant battle and despair scarred the land, ending some bloodlines and marring others, the significance of Vaelith Sonati became apparent.  The constant push and pull between tradition, ideology, and a marked inclusion of the external path (demonic interventions and tiefling misanthropy) ebbed and flowed like that of the moons.  Omens of war and unrest could be read within the tidal effigies marked across the land.  This ideological rift led to intermittent conflicts spanning generations. Periods of uneasy peace would occasionally emerge, only to be shattered by renewed hostilities as old wounds were reopened. The Umbralin, with their dark alliances, often gained the upper hand through sheer power, while the Lumineth leveraged their deep connection to the land and traditional magic to mount formidable defenses.

## **The Middle of the Eternal Conflict (\~2,500 years ago)**

- The **Lumineth construct the Wall of Amathorn**, heavily influenced by Aurelion the Resolute, the Bronze Dragon known as The Pillar of Amathornian Justice. Aurelion, believing that a firm division was necessary for stability, persuaded the Lumineth that the wall would be a righteous solution to end the war. His presence alone reinforced their conviction, and his speeches became legend among the Lumineth, solidifying their resolve. However, his unwavering stance would later become a source of regret as he witnessed the growing divisions it caused., believing it will **force a final separation** from their Umbralin kin and Tiefling allies.
- Instead of resolving the conflict, the wall **becomes a symbol of betrayal**, fueling anger and rebellion.
- **Ongoing battles rage for centuries,** sometimes cooling but always reigniting as tensions remain unresolved.
- Myendria, formed by Lumineth separatists, rises as a **bastion of traditional elven civilization**, further dividing the factions.

## The construction of the Wall of Amathorn

&#x20;Recognizing the ongoing devastation, the Lumineth sought to impose a definitive solution. In the aftermath of a particularly brutal campaign, they forced the Umbralin to construct the Wall of Amathorn as both a punishment and a physical divide, severing their connection to the Tiefling allies and enshrining their perceived victory in stone. They compelled them to construct the Wall of Amathorn, a monumental barrier symbolizing their forced separation from the Tiefling allies and a testament to their subjugation. This act was intended to sever the Umbralin's external alliances and contain their influence.

In the middle of all the chaos, in the aftermath of a particularly devastating period of conflict, the victorious Lumineth imposed a harsh penance upon the Umbralin. They compelled them to construct the Wall of Amathorn, a monumental barrier symbolizing their forced separation from the Tiefling allies and a testament to their subjugation. This act was intended to sever the Umbralin's external alliances and contain their influence.

## **The Age of Discord (\~250 - 2,000 years ago)**

- The **Eternal Conflict spills into greater world events**, dragging other nations into the struggle.
- **The Wall of Amathorn stands, but remains a contested battleground,** frequently sabotaged and rebuilt.
- **Tieflings, still harboring resentment**, begin gathering their own forces, waiting for an opportunity to reclaim lost alliances.
- The **Great Tiefling War (300 years ago)**, a conflict whose flames were stoked, in part, by the shadowy influence of Malidrax the Rotten, the Harbinger of Chaos. Long before the war erupted, Malidrax worked from the shadows, whispering promises of power and vengeance to Tiefling leaders, subtly providing lost elven knowledge and arcane artifacts to fuel their growing rebellion. While history records the Tieflings as rising up of their own will, few realize how much of their anger was carefully nurtured by an ancient force that sought to reshape the Nine Kingdoms for its own ends. erupts, as **generations of bitterness and betrayal culminate in open war.**
- **The war reshapes regional politics**, reinforcing **the divide between Myendria, Amathorn, and West Amathorn.**

## Continued Strife

The culmination of these internal strife saw the Lumineth seeking a new beginning, leading to the establishment of Myendria. This exodus was not merely a physical relocation but a profound statement of disavowal, leaving behind their Umbralin kin and the tainted alliances they had formed.

## The Modern Fallout

The legacy of Aurelion the Resolute remains a subject of heated debate among modern elves. To the Lumineth, he is revered as a guiding force of justice and wisdom, a dragon whose vision shaped the stability of Amathorn. To the Umbralin and Tieflings, however, he is a symbol of arrogance and misguided intervention, a force that catalyzed division rather than unity. Even among the Lumineth, younger generations question whether his unwavering stance did more harm than good, and whether his later efforts toward reconciliation were too little, too late.

The Great Tiefling War profoundly altered the structure of elven societies involved in the conflict. The Lumineth, once seen as the dominant force of tradition and order, suffered internal divisions as younger generations began to question the morality of their ancestors' actions. Meanwhile, the Umbralin, though weakened militarily, gained an underground network of influence, subtly working to undermine Myendria's control. The war also forced many neutral elven enclaves to choose sides, further fragmenting elven unity across the region.

The Tieflings of West Amathorn, feeling betrayed by the enforced separation and the construction of the Wall, harbored deep resentment. Their historians meticulously chronicled these events, ensuring that the memory of betrayal remained vivid. Over centuries, this festering animosity culminated in the Great Tiefling War, as the Tieflings sought retribution against those they deemed responsible for their plight.

## **The Age of Resilience (Current Era: 0 - 250 years ago)**

- The war has **technically ended**, but its legacy **still influences modern politics and racial tensions**.
- Some **Lumineth seek to repair relations**, but **older grudges and hidden factions prevent true reconciliation**.
- **The Wall of Amathorn stands, but has become a political and cultural wound**, still a **point of contention among modern elves, Tieflings, and bordering nations.**
- **Tensions are rising once more**, as old wounds refuse to heal, and some believe another conflict is inevitable.

## The Enigmatic Elves

Throughout these tumultuous times, the elves maintained an aura of mystery. Their internal conflicts, motivations, and the true nature of their alliances remained elusive to outsiders. Other races could only speculate about the deep-seated beliefs and ancient traditions that fueled such enduring rivalries, adding to the enigmatic reputation of elvenkind.

One such tradition is the **Rite of the Moonlit Oath**, a solemn ceremony performed only once a century, where select Lumineth and Umbralin representatives meet in secret under the twin moons. During this ritual, old grievances are recited, and visions of potential futures are shared, believed to be influenced by Sehanine herself. Despite centuries of conflict, the Rite persists, though few outside the elven communities know its true purpose or significance. Scholars and historians from other races have long speculated on the ceremony’s meaning, some believing it to be an attempt at reconciliation, while others see it as an affirmation of continued division.

Likewise, rumors persist of an unseen force operating in the shadows—whispers of Malidrax the Rotten, the Harbinger of Chaos, manipulating events behind the scenes. While most dismiss these claims as conspiratorial fantasies, certain Tiefling historians and arcane scholars point to subtle patterns in history: moments where conflicts seemed to escalate unnaturally, where access to forbidden magic appeared at just the right time. Though little tangible evidence remains, those who study these anomalies suspect that the true architects of discord have always remained hidden from sight.
