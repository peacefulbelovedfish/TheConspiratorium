Starting with Amathorn - I'm seeking a few rival factions of elves that could have been arguing for years - maybe even thousands of years. 

I'm thinking Dark elves of some sort.
I don't want it to be something about just power, but some sort of argument about right/wrong (disagreement that would be worth holding on to for a long time. )

My gut says this rivalry/war would have gone on for generations, sometimes cooling off for a few decades, but then reignited.  

I'd love for the Elves to still have some degree of mystery about them - that they wouldn't expect the other races to understand.  

It probably started during the Age of Silence.  In fact one faction could have greatly contributed to the development of Myendria, and then it became the division between Amathorn and Myendria.  

The amathornian elves made allies with demons and even the Tieflings of West Amathorn.  When the "good elves" won, they forced their bretheren dark elves to build a wall and disavow their allies in the Tieflings.  The wars lasted for years, and eventually bled into the Age of Discord.  The tiefling historians never forgot, and eventually built forces to siege the Great Tiefling War.
