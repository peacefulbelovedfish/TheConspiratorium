### **Visual Description:**  
A tall, lean elf with piercing silver eyes that never seem to miss a detail. His raven-black hair is always neatly tied back, and he wears a finely tailored dark coat embroidered with subtle, arcane sigils. A silver dagger hangs at his side, its hilt inlaid with an onyx gemstone. His presence commands authority, and his soft-spoken words often carry more weight than a shouted threat.

### **Personality:**  
Riven is a calculating tactician, always several moves ahead of his enemies. He believes in order through control and sees chaos as the downfall of civilization. Though ruthless, he adheres to a strict personal code—he never breaks his word and respects those who prove themselves capable. He views the Umbral Pact not just as a thieves' guild but as a necessary force maintaining balance in the city's underworld.
